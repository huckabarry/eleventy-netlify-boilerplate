Hello, fellow wanderer. I’m Bryan and this is my personal blog, a place where I write short status updates about what’s going on in my life, post photos, and shout into the void. If you’re looking for my planning blog, you can find it [here](https://lowvelocity.org/).

I’m an urban planner by profession. For better or worse, I spend a lot of time thinking about environmental psychology, urban design, landscape architecture, human geography, and transportation systems. I like working with maps and design software.

Growing up in poverty had a big impact on my worldview. As it turns out, formative experiences have a way of sticking. Because of that, I spend an arguably unhealthy amount of time thinking about housing, healthcare, and environmental justice. I try to channel that energy productively by volunteering for causes that align with my values.

At my core, I enjoy creating. Whether that be writing, making music, practicing photography, gardening, cooking, learning web development, or making home improvements, I like to express myself through making things. I consider myself a hobbyist in most of these areas, and a master of none.

Originally from the Great Lakes Region, I’ve called the Pacific Northwest home for going on 10 years now. I’m fiercely proud of my Midwest roots and sometimes suffer intense pangs of nostalgia and longings to return, especially after doom scrolling Zillow listings for a bit.

That said, I do enjoy the climate and landscapes better here on the West Coast. I like to get outdoors with my young family, so there are a lot of photos of our adventures on this site.

I love sci-fi movies, but I have a terrible memory for titles and names, so don’t ask me which ones I’ve seen or who my favorite actors are. I also like geeking out about guitar gear and recently built my own Telecaster.

In 2020, I became an Italian citizen. What started out as a genealogy hobby turned into a decade-long education in Italian bureaucracy. My wife and I sometimes daydream about a part-time life abroad, so I’m interested in connecting with Italians and expats.

This site is hosted on Micro.blog and uses a modified version of the Microwave theme. Some things might be broken from time to time.
